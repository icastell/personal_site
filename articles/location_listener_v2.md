# Using location listener from Google Play Services
==========

First of all you need to add Google Play Services to your project. I'm using Android Studio with Gradle, here you have the steps that your have to follow to integrate play-services in your project:

* Install Google repository. Go to SDK Manager -> Extras -> install 'Google repository'

* In your build.gradle file you have to include:

```xml
	dependencies {
    	compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:4.2.+'
    }
```

```java


```
